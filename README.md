This project Coursera course : Applied Data Science Capstone

For the Toronto neighborhood data, a Wikipedia page exists that has all the information we need to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto.
I will be required to scrape the Wikipedia page and wrangle the data, clean it, and then read it into a pandas  dataframe so that it is in a
structured format like the New York dataset.
Once the data is in a structured format, I can replicate the analysis that we did to the New York City dataset to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto.
